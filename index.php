<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/78998056">Red Burns: In Her Own Words</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/itpred">ITP_NYU</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>The Red Burns Scholarship Fund, begun in 2009 at the time of the ITP30 celebration, was made possible by the donations of generous ITP alums and leadership grants by members of the ITP extended family.</p>

<p>The Fund allows ITP to support current students in need, particularly second year students who typically are not able to access other funding opportunities.</p>

<p>The Fund is named in honor of Red Burns, one of the founders of ITP, and Chair for 28 years. With the belief in the power of collective action -- that motivated, engaged people can make a difference -- please honor her with a pledge to the Red Burns Fund.</p>

<p>Your contributions to the Red Burns Scholarship Fund will keep ITP within the reach of the best and the brightest students, from all over the world, from diverse backgrounds and who will continue to discover and make an as yet unimagined future.</p>

<!-- <p>All who donate $100 or more will receive a copy of  "In Her Own Words," a book of Red's quotes.</p> -->

<p>Maybe you’d be able to pledge $100 a year for 10 years, 20? Maybe you can give more and want to make a matching pledge?</p>

<p>Are we starting to sound like NPR yet?  Let’s sound like ITP. Help us reach our goal to provide funding for scholarships.</p>
